-- Fix permissions for internal_chat_messages table
-- The current RLS policies are too restrictive for the current auth system

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages they sent or received" ON internal_chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own messages" ON internal_chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own messages" ON internal_chat_messages;

-- Create more permissive policies that work with the current system
-- Allow all authenticated operations for now
CREATE POLICY "Allow all select operations" ON internal_chat_messages

CREATE POLICY "Allow all insert operations" ON internal_chat_messages
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all update operations" ON internal_chat_messages
  FOR UPDATE USING (true);

-- Alternative: Disable RLS temporarily for testing
-- ALTER TABLE internal_chat_messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the changes
